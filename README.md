# AnchorSpider 

A very simple script to recursively find all links of a website and print the result in result.txt in the form of Array.

The Array can be used as desired, example. as an input to some accessibility checker tools that expect links in the form of Array but we don't know all the links of a website (if some CMS is involved).
